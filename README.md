# CampOut
CampOut is a web platform that uses crowdsourcing to compile detailed campground information from campgrounds all around the world into one convenient location. It is the sole resource that someone needs to plan a camping trip.


## Here's a usage scenario:

You're planning a trip to Mount Rainier National Park, and you'd like to camp in the area.\
\
First, you go to the Mount Rainier National Park Website to look for campgrounds. _**On this website, there's no single map that shows all of the campground locations, so you have to look at several maps**_ to figure out where each campground is. Even then, it's not clear where exactly each of the campgrounds is located in the park, and which ones require advance reservations and which ones are first come, first served.\
\
So then you decide to start looking outside of the park, in the surrounding areas: there's two different National Forests nearby, as well as a Washington State Forest. _**Each National Forest has its own website, policies, and locations for car camping, as does the State Forest, so you'll need to look at three more websites**_ to see all of your car camping options.\
\
And after you do all of that, you think you may want to do some backpacking instead of car camping, so now you need to _**go back and look at all four websites to see the various backpacking campgrounds**_, and figure out if you need a permit or reservation, and then figure out where you need to go to get your permit, then figure out which trail you'll take to get to your backpacking campground...\
\
**Ugh, do you even want to go anymore?!**

### CampOut eliminates all of that hassle.

It has all National Park, National Forest, State Park, and State Forest campground locations on just ONE site, as well as reservation and permit information, recent photos and reviews, campground amenities, and trailhead names for backpacking sites.
